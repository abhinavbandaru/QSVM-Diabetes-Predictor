# QSVM-Implementation
This is an Implementation of QSVM on diabetes dataset available publicly. The accuracy on a quantum computer simulator with ~800 data points is 63.64.<br />
The accuracy on an actual Quantum computer with 50 data points was 52.12 as expected due to less data points. (Complete set could not be used due to qbit limitation)
